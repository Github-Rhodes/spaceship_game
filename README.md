# 2d Space Shooter Game (Unofficial Title)
### About
This design was based loosely on two games; 1942 (a vertical scrolling shooter game made by Capcom) and Spaced Invaders (a shooter game made by Midway). In this design I used royalty free icons and images to make a game based on these 2d shooter games.

### Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript and JQuery

### Approach:
- pseudocode basic functions in js & html
- transferred it to javascript
- test my game
- add css styling

### Link to my game:
https://github-rhodes.github.io/game/spaceship/

### Unsolved Problems:
- need a reset game option/other than reload

### Stretch Goals
- domain with login/username to keep scores
- add optional manual controls for shooting
- add hit points to player ship and add a boss mode
- eventually add sound
- add more background features such as console
